Description:
Data Mining: Mushroom Identification (R Code)

Summary: 
Mushroom identification joint project with Baskar Dakshin for Data Mining Class. 
Analyzed a mushroom data set by developing R code for cleaning and visualizing the data, as well as code for the following models: 
Na√Øve Bayes, Association Rule Mining, K-Means Clustering, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. 
Determined that odor is the strongest predictor of whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible.

Notes:
In order to run the .R file, the .csv file and corpus folders are needed.
The .Rmd and .ipynb files have been provided as alternatives to the .R file, but are not required.
